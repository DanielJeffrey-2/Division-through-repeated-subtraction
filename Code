#This program calculates a quotient using loops and subraction, without division for positive numbers.

x = int(input('Input your dividend:'))
y = int(input('Input your divisor:'))

temp = x
quotient = 0

while temp >= y:
   quotient = quotient + 1
   temp = temp - y

remainder = temp

print('The quotient is:', quotient)
print('The remainder is:', remainder)
